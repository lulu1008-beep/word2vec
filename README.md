This repository contains the coding and dataset as described in this paper: 

**Warmth and Competence of ethnic stereotypes in American English: A data driven machine learning approach**

To be specific, <br/>

   -The ``Brown Family Corpora`` folder contains the raw corpus data of the Brown, Frown, and Crown corpora; <br/>
  
   -The ``word2vec`` folder contains Python files to pre-process the three corpora and then fine-tune the Google News vectors to train the three corpus data for word embeddings; <br/>
  
  -The ``top 100.py`` file gets the words associated with Warm and Competence in this study;<br/>
  
  -The ``SimScore_Brown_NegC_Whites`` folder contains coding necessary to obtain cosine similarity scores. Taking Brown corpus as an example, we run the coding file to  investigate the negative-Competence in relation to Whites.
